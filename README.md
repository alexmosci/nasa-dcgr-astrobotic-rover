# NASA DGCR Project: Astrobotic Rover Control & Mapping

## Overview
This repository contains software for the Astrobotic rover, developed as part of the NASA Dynamic Ground Coverage Robotics (DGCR) project, providing manual rover control via Bluetooth controller and autonomous navigation along a coverage path. It includes all components needed for autonomous operation, such as elevation map creation from LiDAR data, traversability binary map generation, and coverage path planning.
