# NASA DGCR Project â€“ Astrobotic Rover Control & Mapping

## Overview
This repository contains software developed for the NASA Dynamic Ground Coverage Robotics (DGCR) project, providing manual rover control via Bluetooth controller and autonomous navigation along a coverage path. It includes all components needed for autonomous operation, such as elevation map creation from LiDAR data, traversability binary map generation, and coverage path planning.
